       "\"PRIYANKA VERGADIA: Did you know that most of the time spent by data scientists goes into wrangling data? More specifically, in feature engineering, which is transforming raw data into high-quality input signals for ML models. But this process is often inefficient and brittle. Well I'm Priyanka, and in this video we will identify the key challenges with feature engineering, how Vertex Feature Store help solve them, and see a quick demo. Now what are the key challenges with ML features? The first is that they are hard to share and reuse across your different steps of the ML workflow and across projects, which results in duplicate efforts. Second is that it is hard to serve in production reliably with lower latency, and the third is that there is an inadvertent skew in feature values between training and serving, usually, which causes your model quality to degrade over time. That is exactly where Vertex Feature Store comes in. It's a fully managed and unified solution to share, discover, and serve machine learning features at scale across different teams within your organization. And it also helps reduce the time to build and deploy your AI ML applications by making it easy to manage and organize your ML features in one place. It makes the features reusable, easy to serve, and avoids skew. Now let's see how to set it up. In the console, in Vertex AI, we see the Feature tab. To get started, let's click on this documentation and explore, using Feature Store section. Now the first thing you need is a Feature Store. At the time of this recording, Feature Store is in preview so just know that depending on when you're watching this, there might be more options and updates that you would see. You cannot create a Feature Store in the console, so let's use this sample notebook to learn how to create it using the SDK. This sample uses a movie recommendations data set and the task is to train\""
